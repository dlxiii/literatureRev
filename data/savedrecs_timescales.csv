Val; Khazaei, Bahram","Timescales of transport through Lower Green Bay","JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH","","0380-1330","10.1016/j.jglr.2020.06.010","","Contaminated sediments, poor water quality, and lost or altered habitat in Lower Green Bay and Fox River in the 1980s led to its listing as an Area of Concern by the International Joint Commission. Previous studies on the geophysics and health of the bay demonstrated the need for estimates of transport timescales. Such estimates can contribute to improved understanding of the transport and fate of nutrients, contaminants, and biogeochemical processes in the bay. This study reviews definitions of residence time and flushing time, estimates the temporal distribution of flushing time, the spatial and temporal distributions of residence time, and horizontal diffusivities. The study used a previously developed hydrodynamic model, a drifter experiment, a lake particle transport model, and methods appropriate for the estimation of transport timescales. The estimated residence time for lower Green Bay, 56 +/- 16 days, is smaller than a previous estimate of 190 days for the whole bay, and had values similar to the estimated flushing times. The closeness between those timescales demonstrates the important role of water exchange across the Chambers Island transect. Flushing time and residence time do not follow the same trends in monthly variability because the former depends directly on water exchange across Chambers Island, while the later depends, in addition, on tributary inflows and the circulation patterns in the bay. The study includes a discussion of the relations between the timescales of transport and the previous studies of biogeochemical processes, such as trophic conditions, spatial distribution of cyanobacteria, cold-water intrusions, and hypoxia.

Due to substantial anthropogenic influences since 1964, the water quality in the bay had deteriorated seriously. Thus urgent measures should be taken to protect the water body. In this study, a numerical model was calibrated for water surface elevation and tidal current from August 14 to August 26, 2011. Comparisons of observed and simulated data showed that the model reproduced the tidal range and phase and the variations of current at different periods fairly well. The calibrated model was then applied to investigate spatial flushing pattern of the bay by calculation of residence time. The results obtained from a series of model experiments demonstrated that the residence time increased from 10 day at the bay mouth to more than 70 day at the upper bay. The average residence time over the whole bay was 49.5 day. In addition, the adaptation of flushing homogeneity curve showed that the residence time in the bay varied smoothly.

The RT focuses on only the total time a water parcel spends in a system (i.e., control region). However, for a system that consists of several subregions (e.g., sub-bays or functional zones), the RT will not include information about the time spent in different subregions. To determine the RT compositions in different subregions, partial residence times (PRTs) are proposed and defined as the amount of time a water parcel spends in different subregions until leaving the control region. The equations for PRTs are derived using the adjoint method, which can quickly determine the variation of PRTs in time and space. To validate the PRT diagnostic equation and numerical model, a test is conducted in an idealized 1D channel with idealized tidal currents. The numerical results are in excellent agreement with the analytical solution. Finally, the PRT method is applied to tide-dominated Jiaozhou Bay. The PRTs in six functional subregions of Jiaozhou Bay are derived, and the detailed RT compositions of the different functional subregions are presented. The application indicates that PRTs could provide detailed information and new insights into the water exchange process.","2019-09","2021-10-08 06:36:24","2021-10-08 14:08:50","","1023-1036","","9","69","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000482404300003","","","","<p>停留时间 (RT) 是一种广泛用于量化半封闭系统中的水交换率和质量传输时间尺度的诊断方法。 RT 仅关注水包在系统（即控制区域）中花费的总时间。但是，对于由多个子区域（例如，子托架或功能区）组成的系统，RT 将不包括有关在不同子区域中花费的时间的信息。为了确定不同子区域中的 RT 组成，部分停留时间 (PRT) 被提出并将其定义为水包在不同子区域中花费的时间，直到离开控制区域。 PRT的方程是使用伴随法推导出来的，可以快速确定PRT在时间和空间上的变化。为了验证 PRT 诊断方程和数值模型，在具有理想化潮汐流的理想化 1D 通道中进行了测试。数值结果与解析解非常吻合。最后，将PRT方法应用于潮汐主导的胶州湾。推导出胶州湾六个功能分区的PRT，并给出了不同功能分区的详细RT组成。该应用表明，PRT 可以提供有关水交换过程的详细信息和新见解。</p>","/Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/9WSG99PU/Lin and Liu - 2019 - Partial residence times determining residence tim.pdf","","Jiaozhou Bay; partial residence times; residence time; semi-enclosed; total time; water exchange rate and mass transport timescale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Flushing time, residence time and age are evaluated, providing rigorously defined parameters to describe the rate of offshore freshwater transport and basin replenishment. Additional challenges encountered when assessing these timescales in a tidally mixed regime are highlighted by idealised models.Climatological river gauge data reveals that the numerous local rivers contribute an average of 203 m(3) s(-1) of freshwater to Liverpool Bay. Based upon the mean salinity distribution, this would suggest a flushing time of approximately 136 days. The mean residence time of the region is approximately 103 days although small concentrations of water are retained over several years due to vigorous tidal mixing.Age in the region is highly variable with regular oscillations caused by tidal advection, whilst long term fluctuations are governed by river flow rates. The mean age gradient is directed offshore, approximately parallel to both the salinity gradient and the major axis of the tidal ellipse, with basin wide average magnitude of 6 days km(-1). It is shown that salinity may be used to estimate the age of freshwater, which is not directly observable in practice. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A real-time calibrated hydrodynamic Chesapeake Bay model in 3 Dimensions (CH3D), employing a boundary-fitted curvilinear grid, is used for the study. The long-term transport properties, represented by AW, are investigated under the conditions of low river inflow of 1995 and high river inflow of 1996. as well as for constant mean inflows. The influences of freshwater, density-induced circulation, and wind-induced transport on age distribution have been investigated. Model results show that river inflows, wind stress, and density-induced circulation play important roles in controlling the long-term transport in the Bay. The model results shows that it requires 120-300 days for a marked change in the characteristics of the Pollutant Source discharged into the Bay from the Susquehanna River to affect significantly the conditions near the mouth under different hydrodynamic conditions. An increase of river discharge results in increases of downstream residual current and gravitational circulation. and thus reduces AW.

This timescale, generally referred to as the hydraulic residence time, provides a first-order description of multiple and complex processes that drive transport. The procedures to estimate these transport timescales are reviewed and, through the analysis of numerical simulations, the links between residence timescales and the underlying hydrodynamic processes in a canonical freshwater embayment, Little Sodus Bay (LSB), are explored. LSB has negligible through-flow and is connected permanently to Lake Ontario (LO) through a narrow and shallow channel. Exchange in the channel is the result of a multiple balance where spatial thermal variations (baroclinic forcing), oscillations in water level (barotropic forcing), frictional mixing, wind, and the effects of unsteadiness are all important. The simulations indicate that baroclinic processes are the dominant exchange and mixing mechanisms in embayments like LSB. The largest density gradients across the channel are caused by episodic upwelling events in LO during the stratified season, when exchange rates increase by at least an order of magnitude.

Hydrodynamic timescales were estimated and analyzed using the particle tracking results. Flushing of the estuary was found to transition from tidally enhanced to river dominated for Q > 1715 m(3) s(-1). A simple power law regression was found to accurately represent the spatially averaged timescales (R-2 > 0.99) for tidal and river forcing. Spatially averaged timescales generally ranged from 4 to 130 days, with large deviations related to particle initial position, magnitude of river discharge, and local winds. The longest timescales were found in areas where adverse pressure gradients contributed to water retention as a result of separated flow and closed-cell circulation. Increasing river discharge enhanced the barotropic pressure gradient, which dominated the along-and across-estuary momentum balances in all but the minimum flow scenario where the across estuary balance was geostrophic. Meteorological forcing was found to increase the spatial variance in hydrodynamic timescales by as much as 60% as compared with cases with discharge and tides only. The increased spatial variability was a result of inhibited flushing due to enhanced northerly flows along the shorelines and expanded regions of closed cell circulation in the eastern portion of the estuary.","2016-11","2021-10-08 06:36:25","2021-10-08 15:04:14","","1374-1388","","6","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000387526900010","","","","<p>停留时间、暴露时间和冲洗时间是描述水体内物理质量传输的流体动力学时间尺度的例子。通过使用二维深度综合环流模型和拉格朗日粒子跟踪模型对阿拉巴马州莫比尔湾的水动力模型模拟，研究了这些措施对潮汐和流量的响应和空间变异性。使用粒子跟踪结果估计和分析水动力时间尺度。河口的冲洗被发现从潮汐增强过渡到以 Q &gt; 1715 m(3) s(-1) 为主的河流。发现一个简单的幂律回归可以准确地表示潮汐和河流强迫的空间平均时间尺度 (R-2 &gt; 0.99)。空间平均时间尺度通常在 4 到 130 天之间，与粒子初始位置、河流流量大小和当地风速相关的偏差很大。最长的时间尺度出现在由于分离流和闭孔循环导致不利压力梯度导致保水的区域。河流流量的增加增强了正压压力梯度，这在除跨河口平衡是地转的最小流量情景之外的所有情况下主导了沿河口和跨河口动量平衡。与仅排放和潮汐的情况相比，发现气象强迫使水动力时间尺度的空间变化增加了 60%。增加的空间变异性是由于沿海岸线向北流动的增强和河口东部封闭细胞环流区域的扩大而抑制冲洗的结果。</p>","/Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/UE3KCC8K/Webb and Marr - 2016 - Spatial Variability of Hydrodynamic Timescales in .pdf","","exposure time; flushing time; Lagrangian particle tracking model; Mobile Bay; particle tracking; residence time; two-dimensional depth integrated circulation model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A three-dimensional model was used to investigate the effect of wind on transport time by using the concept of water age (WA) in the tidal Rappahannock River, a western tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, USA. The model was calibrated for water level, current, and salinity. A series of experiments regarding the effects of wind on WA was conducted under various dynamic conditions. The effect of wind on transport timescale depends strongly on the competition between the wind and buoyancy forcings, and on the pre-status of the circulation. A down-estuary wind generally decreases WA along the estuary. An up-estuary wind increases WA substantially because it changes the vertical mixing and estuarine circulation more significantly. When the buoyancy forcing increases, the up-estuary wind effect decreases whereas the down-estuary wind effect increases. A 2-day period wind pulse with a maximum speed of 15 m s(-1) can alter WA for 3 days; but the wind influence on WA lasts up to 40 days in the simulation. Both local and non-local wind forcings alter WA distribution. The local wind enhances vertical mixing and changes the gravitational circulation in the downstream portion of the estuary whereas it enhances transport in the freshwater portion of the estuary. Consequently, the local wind has a significant impact on WA distribution. In contrast, the non-local wind does not change the gravitational circulation significantly by imposing setup (setdown) of water level at the open boundary, resulting in a lesser impact on WA distribution.

The basin considered here is the Dutch coastal bay Oosterschelde (Eastern Scheldt in English) on the east coast of the North Sea. Using a calibrated and validated 3D hydrodynamic model, conservative tracer experiments were conducted to estimate turnover times. Sensitivity scenarios were run to examine the relative roles of tides, winds, and gravitational flow in driving the intra-annual variability. Results indicate that gravitational flow and winds contribute most to the intra-annual variability of turnover times in the Oosterschelde. Freshets from the Westerschelde and Rhine Rivers extending to the mouth of the bay can reduce the axial density gradient and gravitational flow, increasing turnover times of the basin. The prevailing southwesterly winds, when of sufficient magnitude (> 5 m/s), modify the spatial patterns of turnover times especially in shallow waters. Tides force flushing of the bay but do not induce significant intra-annual variability.

The vertical exchange time (VET) is introduced in this study to quantify the physical processes that regulate the DO replenishment in the Chesapeake Bay. A 3-D numerical model was applied to simulate the circulation, VET, and DO. Results indicate that VET is a suitable parameter for evaluating the bottom DO condition over both seasonal and interannual timescales. The VET is negatively correlated with the bottom DO. Hypoxia (DO <2 mg L-1) will develop in the Bay when VET is greater than 23 days in summer if mean total DO consumption rate is about 0.3 g O-2 m(-3) d(-1). This critical VET value may vary around 23 days when the total DO consumption rate changes. The VET volume (volume of water mass with VET >23 days) can account for 77% of variations of hypoxic volume in the main Bay. The VET cannot explain all the DO variations as it can only account for the contribution of physical processes that regulate DO replenishment. It is found that the short-term vertical exchange process is highly controlled by the wind forcing. The VET volume decreases when the high-speed wind events are frequent. The summertime VET volume is less sensitive to short-term variations (pulses) of river discharge. It is sensitive to the total amount of river discharge and the high VET volume can be expected in the wet year.","2013-11","2021-10-08 06:36:26","2021-10-08 13:27:41","","6017-6029","","11","118","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000329867900012","","","","<p>河口底水中溶解氧 (DO) 的补充取决于受外力影响显着的物理过程。本研究中引入了垂直交换时间 (VET)，以量化调节切萨皮克湾 DO 补给的物理过程。应用 3-D 数值模型来模拟循环、VET 和 DO。结果表明，VET 是评估季节性和年际时间尺度上的底部溶解氧条件的合适参数。 VET 与底部 DO 呈负相关。如果平均总 DO 消耗率约为 0.3 g O-2 m(-3) d(-1)，则当夏季 VET 大于 23 天时，海湾将出现缺氧（DO &lt;2 mg L-1）。当总溶解氧消耗率发生变化时，这个关键的 VET 值可能会在 23 天左右发生变化。 VET 体积（VET &gt; 23 天的水团体积）可占主湾缺氧体积变化的 77%。 VET 不能解释所有的 DO 变化，因为它只能解释调节 DO 补充的物理过程的贡献。发现短期垂直交换过程受风力高度控制。当高速风事件频繁时，VET 体积减小。夏季 VET 量对河流流量的短期变化（脉冲）不太敏感。它对河流流量的总量很敏感，并且在雨季预计会有较高的 VET 量。</p>","/Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/JFD99WBE/Hong and Shen - 2013 - Linking dynamics of transport timescale and variat.pdf","","Chesapeake Bay; vertical exchange time; VET","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Water exchange in Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the US, has been extensively studied, yet its long-term interannual variability and its relationship with the external forcings are not fully understood. Based on a long-term (1980-2011) numerical model simulation, this study examines the water exchanges between Chesapeake Bay and the adjacent coastal shelf, between different regions within the bay, as well as their relationships with river discharge, wind, and residence time. Through an EOF analysis of the bottom inflow and surface outflow at seven selected cross-bay sections, we found that over 90% of the spatiotemporal variations of water exchange can be explained by the first two EOF modes, which are highly correlated with the freshwater discharge and northwesterly wind, respectively. Unlike the outflow that increases linearly with river discharge as commonly expected, the inflow responds non-monotonically to river discharge. The relationship between the river discharge and inflow can be described by a combination of the Michaelis-Menten/Monod equation and a linearly decreasing function, i.e., the inflow initially increases with river discharge due to enhanced gravitational circulation and then levels, and gradually declines due to overwhelming seaward barotropic current. We found a locally enhanced water exchange in the lower-middle bay, which can be attributed to the persistent reflux of surface outflow due to the irregular geometry and rapid shoaling in the channel bathymetry. The water exchange and the mean residence time can be connected reciprocally through the bay volume, yet the validation of this relationship depends on the timescale to be considered since the residence time at a given time is controlled by the future hydrodynamics. A delay effect should be considered when using the relationship to estimate outflow interchangeably with the direct computation of the outflow.","2021-03","2021-10-08 06:36:26","2021-10-08 15:45:01","","","","","215","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000609114700003","","","","<p>在典型的河口，以底部流入和表面流出为特征的水交换决定了盐分、养分、污染物以及悬浮沉积物和生物的运输和再分配。美国最大的河口切萨皮克湾的水交换已得到广泛研究，但其长期年际变化及其与外部强迫的关系尚未完全了解。本研究基于长期（1980-2011 年）数值模型模拟，研究了切萨皮克湾与相邻沿海陆架之间、湾内不同区域之间的水交换，以及它们与河流流量、风和居住地的关系。时间。通过对七个选定跨湾断面的底部流入和表面流出的 EOF 分析，我们发现超过 90% 的水交换时空变化可以用前两种 EOF 模式来解释，这与淡水排放高度相关和西北风，分别。与通常预期的随河流流量线性增加的流出量不同，流入量对河流流量的响应非单调。河流流量与流入量之间的关系可以用Michaelis-Menten/Monod方程和线性递减函数的组合来描述，即流入量最初因重力环流增强而随河流流量增加，然后水平下降，然后逐渐下降。压倒性的向海正压流。我们发现中下海湾局部增强的水交换，这可归因于由于不规则几何形状和通道测深中的快速浅滩而导致地表流出物的持续回流。水交换和平均停留时间可以通过隔间体积相互联系，但这种关系的验证取决于要考虑的时间尺度，因为给定时间的停留时间由未来的流体动力学控制。当使用该关系来估计流出量与直接计算流出量可互换时，应考虑延迟效应。</p>","/Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/HCBHL3TL/Xiong et al. - 2021 - Water exchange and its relationships with external.pdf","","Chesapeake Bay; residence time; water exchange","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Residence time (RT) is an important indicator used to determine the water exchange rate of coastal oceans, and it has a significant influence on coastal ecosystems and the environment. In this study, the RT and its seasonal variability within the Bohai Sea were investigated using a 3-D hydrodynamic model and the adjoint method of the RT. The model results show that the annual mean RT in the Bohai Sea is 3.43 years, and the RT increases from the Bohai Strait to the northwestern coast. The seasonal variability of the RT averaged over the entire Bohai Sea is not obvious; however, the regional RT has a significant seasonal variation, which could be more than 290% on average. When the monsoon winds were removed from the model, the sensitivity experiment showed an annual mean RT increase of similar to 90% with negligible seasonal variations in most areas of the Bohai Sea. The wind-induced residual current controls the seasonal variation in ocean circulation and induces the seasonal variability in RT; thus, monsoon winds play a dominant role in the seasonal variations of the water exchange rate in the Bohai Sea. Sensitivity experiments also suggest that tides can slow the water exchange rate, whereas the baroclinic processes and river runoff can accelerate the water exchange rate in the region near the Yellow River estuary. This study highlights the critical role of monsoon winds in affecting seasonal variabilities in the coastal transport timescale and exchange rate.","2021-02","2021-10-08 06:36:27","2021-10-08 14:54:18","","157-173","","2","71","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000605121100001","","","","<p>渤海是中国的一个大型半封闭海湾，运输时间跨度超过 1 年。滞留时间（RT）是决定近海海洋水交换率的重要指标，对近海生态系统和环境有显着影响。在这项研究中，使用 3-D 流体动力学模型和 RT 的伴随方法研究了渤海内的 RT 及其季节性变化。模型结果表明，渤海的年平均RT为3.43年，RT从渤海海峡向西北海岸增加。整个渤海平均RT的季节性变化不明显；然而，区域 RT 具有显着的季节性变化，平均可能超过 290%。当从模型中去除季风时，敏感性实验表明，渤海大部分地区的年平均 RT 增加接近 90%，季节性变化可忽略不计。风致残流控制海洋环流的季节变化，诱发 RT 的季节变化；因此，季风在渤海水交换率的季节变化中起主导作用。敏感性实验还表明，潮汐可以减缓水的交换速度，而斜压过程和河流径流可以加快黄河口附近地区的水交换速度。这项研究强调了季风在影响沿海运输时间尺度和汇率的季节性变化方面的关键作用。</p>","/Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/LKKFH2FS/Luo et al. - 2021 - Seasonal variations in the water residence time in.pdf","","adjoint method; Bohai Sea; residence time; semi-enclosed bay","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Pearl River Delta is one of the deltas with degradation of the water quality and ecological condition. The Pearl River Estuary (PRE) was investigated to reveal the fate and transport timescales of TeDS in order to provide guidance on water resource management and pollutant transport prediction. By using passive tracers in a calibrated 3D numerical model, the TeDS transports from five different outlet groups were investigated systematically. The TeDS transport time was computed by using the concept of water age, which is a measure of the time that has elapsed since the tracer was transported from the upstream boundary to the downstream concerned area. The tracer impacted area was defined by the area with tracer concentrations > 0.2 (arbitrary unit). The domains that were impacted by the tracer coming from each outlet group were identified separately. In the wet season, the impacted area was larger than in other seasons. The most prominent variations appeared in the Jiaomen-Hengmen-Hongqili (JHH) and Modaomen (MD) outlets. The hydrodynamic conditions controlled the offshore spreading of the TeDS. Assuming the TeDS were conservative, it took approximately 10-20 days for the TeDS to be transported from the head water to the entrance of the outlet. For the TeDS coming from the head water of the Humen outlet, it took approximately 40 (80) days for the TeDS to be transported out of the mouth of the Lingding Bay during the wet (dry) season. For the case of the TeDS coming from the head water of the JHH outlets, it took approximately 20 (40) days for the TeDS to be transported out of the Lingding Bay during the wet (dry) season. For the MD, Jiti and Yamen-Hutiao outlets, it usually took approximately 10 days for the TeDS to be transported from the head water to the inner shelf. The correlation coefficient between the river flow and tracer concentrations was 0.78, and between the river flow and transport time it was -0.70 at a station in the lower Lingding Bay. At the estuary mouth, the impacts of other forcing fields got stronger.","2020-05","2021-10-08 06:36:27","2021-10-08 15:06:53","","","","5","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000555915200014","","","","<p>由于陆地溶解物质 (TeDS) 的大量输入，人口稠密的河流三角洲正在经历海洋环境退化。珠江三角洲是水质和生态状况恶化的三角洲之一。对珠江口 (PRE) 进行了调查，以揭示 TeDS 的归宿和运输时间尺度，以便为水资源管理和污染物运输预测提供指导。通过在校准的 3D 数值模型中使用被动示踪剂，系统地研究了来自五个不同出口组的 TeDS 传输。 TeDS 传输时间是通过使用水龄的概念计算的，水龄是对示踪剂从上游边界传输到下游相关区域所经过的时间的度量。示踪剂影响区域定义为示踪剂浓度 &gt; 0.2（任意单位）的区域。受来自每个插座组的示踪剂影响的域被单独确定。雨季受灾面积大于其他季节。最显着的变化出现在角门-横门-红旗里（JHH）和磨刀门（MD）网点。水动力条件控制了 TeDS 的海上扩散。假设 TeDS 是保守的，将 TeDS 从源头水输送到出口入口大约需要 10-20 天。对于来自虎门出水口源头水的 TeDS，在雨（干）季将 TeDS 运出岭顶湾口需要大约 40（80）天。对于来自 JHH 出口源头水的 TeDS，在雨（干）季将 TeDS 运出岭顶湾需要大约 20（40）天。对于MD、吉提和衙门-虎条网点，TeDS从源头水运到内架通常需要10天左右的时间。河流流量与示踪剂浓度之间的相关系数为0.78，河流流量与运输时间之间的相关系数为-0.70。在河口，其他强迫场的影响更加强烈。</p>","/Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/LJPE4UNW/Hong et al. - 2020 - Study on the Transport of Terrestrial Dissolved Su.pdf","","Pearl River Estuary; water age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yellow River water has a mean age of 3.0 years for the entire Bohai Sea. The spatial variation of the water age is significant: 1.2 years near the Yellow River estuary but 3.9 years in the Liaodong Bay. However, the temporal variation in water age is insignificant. The water particles released at the river mouth need only several days to reach the estuary area. The great water age (1.2 years) near the Yellow River estuary is caused by the presence of old water particles that initially left this area but returned to this area again. Without the reentry of Yellow River water from the Yellow Sea to the Bohai Sea, the mean age of Yellow River water in the entire Bohai Sea decreases to 1.2 years. Calculations without tidal forcing give a reduction in water age by more than 50%, suggesting that tidal forcing plays the most dominant role in controlling the age of Yellow River water in the Bohai Sea.

The model has been verified against field measured tidal and salinity data in three typical seasons, including the wet, dry and average rainfall seasons. The model predicted distributions of tidal wave amplitude and salinity level agree generally well with the field measurements. The model is then enhanced by including capabilities for calculating the two timescales. The numerical model predictions show that both the freshwater discharge and tidal water elevation affect significantly the values of residence time and exposure time. The return coefficient is found to be about 0.5. Using a regression analysis, an exponential function has beenderived to correlate the timescales to the freshwater discharge. In the dry season the average residence time and exposure time are up to about 6 days and 12 days, while in the wet season these values are reduced to 3 days and 5 days, respectively. Generally, in all three types of seasons, the exposure time is about two times greater than the residence time, which demonstrates that there is a high possibility for water to re-enter the PRE after leaving the estuary. Both the residence time and exposure time decrease as the initial water elevation increases, which indicates that a contaminant will stay in the PRE for a longer time if it is released at a low tide.

The numerical model was calibrated against field measured data for various tidal conditions. The model simulated current speeds and directions generally agreed well with the field data. The model was then further developed and applied to study the two transport timescales, namely the exposure time and residence time for the hyper-tidal Severn Estuary. The numerical model predictions showed that the inflow from the River Severn under high flow conditions reduced the residence and exposure times by 1.5 to 3.5% for different tidal ranges and tracer release times. For spring tide conditions, releasing a tracer at high water reduced the residence time and exposure time by 49.0% and 11.9%, respectively, compared to releasing the tracer at low water. For neap tide conditions, releasing at high water reduced the residence time and exposure time by 31.6% and 8.0%, respectively, compared to releasing the tracer at low water level. The return coefficient was found to be vary between 0.75 and 0.88 for the different tidal conditions, which indicates that the returning water effects for different tidal ranges and release times are all relatively high. For all flow and tide conditions, the exposure times were significantly greater than the residence times, which demonstrated that there was a high possibility for water and/or pollutants to re-enter the Severn Estuary after leaving it on an ebb tide. The fractions of water and/or pollutants re-entering the estuary for spring and neap tide conditions were found to be very high, giving 0.75-0.81 for neap tides, and 0.79-0.88 for spring tides. For both the spring and neap tides, the residence and exposure times were lower for high water level release. Spring tide conditions gave significantly lower residence and exposure times.

To eliminate man-made errors, decrease computational effort, and increase simulation efficiency, exposure time was evaluated under different hydrodynamic conditions for a bay to investigate the impact of the external domain on the accuracy of the computational results for exposure time. The exposure time was explicitly defined and computed using a hydrodynamic model and tracer experiments for a set of ten external domain sizes (EDS), five external domain lengths (EDL), and three special hydrodynamic conditions. The results indicated that the external domain had a significant influence on the exposure time, and the intensity of this influence was related to hydrodynamic conditions. The sensitivity of the exposure time to the external domain increased with increasing tidal range, while freshwater inflows decreased this sensitivity. However, the variation trends for exposure time with different EDS and EDL were independent of the hydrodynamic conditions. Considering the computational efficiency (maximum), the calculated error (minimum) of the exposure time, and the impact of the boundary conditions (minimum), the recommended EDS and EDL range from 9 to 13 times the initial domain size and 1.30 to 1.45 times the length in the bay, respectively.

The age is defined in this study as the time elapsed since a water parcel entered the headwater of the estuary. A theoretical deduction shows that the vertical age profile can be explained by the extended Hansen and Rattray's Central Region theory, which is mainly controlled by gravitational circulation in the estuary. The age distributions in the James River under different hydrological and hydrodynamic conditions are then calculated through a series of model simulations using a real-time three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The influences of tide, freshwater inflow, and density-induced circulation on age distribution have been investigated. The model results show that the vertical age distribution resembles the stratification pattern of the salinity in the regions where stratification persists. The age difference between the surface and bottom is larger during neap tide than during spring tide. The vertical difference is about 5 days under mean river flow conditions. The model results indicate that river flow is one of the dominant factors that influence mean age distribution. It takes 95 and 35 days, respectively, for a water parcel discharged into the estuary to be transported out of the estuary under mean,and high flow conditions. The tidal influence is more significant in the downstream portions of the estuary. The density-induced circulation contributes to the long-term transport substantially in the downstream estuary where the stratification persists. The influence of density-induced circulation on age distribution can be more than 45 days under the mean flow condition.

A comprehensive, particle-based reanalysis of an existing circulation model was used to map the area of influence of each of these rivers over a typical seasonal cycle. Each of the 131,000 particles released in the 15 rivers was associated with a freshwater volume, a nutrient load, and a fecal coliform load based on statistics from 10 years of Washington Department of Ecology monitoring data. Simple assumptions regarding mortality and nutrient utilization/export rates were used to estimate the decrease in bacterial and nutrient load as individual parcels of river water age. Reconstructions of basin-scale volume fluxes and salinities from the particle inventory provide consistency checks on the particle calculation, according to methods suitable for error analysis in a wide range of particle-based estuarine residence time studies. Results suggest that river contributions to total freshwater content in Puget Sound are highly nonlocal in spring and summer, with distant, large rivers (the Fraser and Skagit) accounting for a large fraction of total freshwater. However, bacterial mortality and nutrient export rates are relatively fast compared with transport timescales, and so significant loadings associated with major rivers are in most cases only seen close to river mouths. One notable exception is fecal coliform concentration in Bellingham Bay and Samish Bay, which lie north of Puget Sound proper; there, it appears that the Fraser River may rival local rivers (the Samish and Nooksack) as a pathogen source, with the much higher flow volume of the Fraser compensating for its remoteness.","2015-05","2021-10-08 06:36:32","2021-10-08 14:16:06","","735-753","","3","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000351613100003","","","","<p>普吉特海湾是一个由 14 条主要河流组成的河口内陆海，也受到附近弗雷泽河的强烈影响。对现有环流模型进行了基于粒子的综合再分析，用于绘制每条河流在典型季节性周期中的影响区域。根据华盛顿生态部 10 年监测数据的统计数据，15 条河流中释放的 131,000 个颗粒中的每一个都与淡水量、营养负荷和粪便大肠菌负荷有关。使用关于死亡率和养分利用率/出口率的简单假设来估计细菌和养分负荷随着河水年龄的各个部分的减少。根据适用于范围广泛的基于颗粒的河口停留时间研究中的误差分析的方法，从颗粒清单中重建盆地尺度的体积通量和盐度为颗粒计算提供了一致性检查。结果表明，春季和夏季，河流对普吉特海湾淡水总量的贡献是高度非局部的，遥远的大河流（弗雷泽河和斯卡吉特河）占淡水总量的很大一部分。然而，与运输时间尺度相比，细菌死亡率和养分输出速度相对较快，因此与主要河流相关的大量负载在大多数情况下只能在靠近河口的地方看到。一个值得注意的例外是位于普吉特湾北部的贝灵厄姆湾和萨米什湾的粪便大肠菌群浓度。在那里，弗雷泽河似乎可以作为病原体来源与当地河流（萨米什河和努克萨克河）相媲美，而弗雷泽河的高得多的流量弥补了它的偏远性。</p>","/Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/RNMQ4URN/Banas et al. - 2015 - Patterns of River Influence and Connectivity Among.pdf","","particle-based","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In these environments, water renewal is strongly controlled by diffusion, and it is significantly affected by the return flow (i.e., the fraction of effluent water that returns into the basin on each flood tide). The definition of water age is here modified to account for the return flow, in analogy with exposure time and local flushing time. We consider approximate time scales, whose accuracy is analyzed, in order to overcome problems related to the size of the computational domain and to reduce the computational effort. A new approximate procedure is introduced to estimate water age, which is based on the water aging rate. Also, the concept of local flushing time as a relevant time scale is introduced. Under steady periodic conditions, we demonstrate that the local flushing time quantitatively corresponds to water age, and well approximates exposure time when the flow is dominated by diffusion. Since the effort required to compute water age and exposure time is greater than that required to compute the local flushing time, the present results can also have a practical interest in the assessment of water renewal efficiency of semi-enclosed water basins. The results of a modeling study, in which the lagoon of Venice is used as a benchmark, confirm the substantial quantitative equivalence between these three transport time scales in highly diffusive environments.

In this study, the flushing and residence times within the Arvand River estuary have been estimated using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model called CE-QUAL-W2. The model has been calibrated and verified by two different sets of field data and using the k-epsilon vertical eddy diffusivity scheme. Flushing time has been estimated using different methods such as the tidal prism and fraction of freshwater methods. Moreover, residence times have been investigated using pulse residence time, estuarine residence time and remnant function approaches. The results have shown that different methods yield different time scales, and freshwater inflow has the greatest impact upon estimation of residence time, whereas tidal circulation hardly contributes to residence time at all. It has also been shown that the neap-spring circulation and start phase of simulations have negligible effects on the Arvand's time scales. The investigation of bathymetry showed that two sills of the estuary tend to significantly increase residence time. Understanding the applicability of these time scales and their estimation approaches helps us to evaluate the water quality management of estuaries.

The concept of vertical exchange time was used to quantify the vertical exchange process and was calculated by adding a conservative tracer to the hydrodynamic model. The results revealed vertical exchange time has significant seasonal variation modulated by seasonally changed external forcing, and has similar structure with spatial variation in salinity. During the wet season, remarkably long vertical exchange times (>50 days) occurred at the lower estuary under 10 m depth, which was coincident with the frequently reported hypoxic zone. The entire Pearl River estuary was occupied by water mass with a vertical exchange time of <5 days during the dry season, which indicated the estuary's health condition during this period. Further analyses revealed the seasonal trend of vertical exchange time was closely related with salinity stratification and river runoff in which the lowest vertical exchange times can be estimated by linear regressions in certain stages. Tide modulated these exchange times in different time scales. Spring tide better mixed the water column and thus facilitated the vertical exchange process compared with neap tide. As a result, minimum vertical exchange time during spring tide was about 10 days shorter than that during neap tide. Flood-ebb tide also modulated vertical exchange time in the Pearl River estuary. Vertical exchange time varies with the tide and reached minimum and maximum values during valley and high tides, respectively.","2016","2021-10-08 06:36:35","2021-10-08 13:11:31","","286-295","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000383372800008","","","","<p>作为偶尔出现缺氧的河口，珠江河口被选中通过经过验证的 3-D 数值模型研究其垂直交换过程。垂直交换时间的概念用于量化垂直交换过程，并通过向水动力模型添加保守示踪剂来计算。结果表明，垂直交换时间具有显着的季节性变化，受季节性变化的外强迫调节，并且具有相似的结构与盐度的空间变化。在雨季，在10 m深度以下的下河口发生了非常长的垂直交换时间（&gt; 50天），这与经常报道的缺氧区相吻合。整个珠江河口被水团占据，旱季垂直交换时间&lt;5 d，表明该时期河口的健康状况。进一步分析表明垂直交换时间的季节性趋势与盐度分层和河流径流密切相关，其中最低垂直交换时间可以通过某些阶段的线性回归估计。潮汐在不同的时间尺度上调节了这些交换时间。与小潮相比，大潮更好地混合了水柱，从而促进了垂直交换过程。因此，大潮期间的最小垂直交换时间比小潮期间短约10天。洪水退潮也调节了珠江口的垂直交换时间。垂直交换时间随潮汐变化，分别在低潮和高潮时达到最小值和最大值。</p>","","","Pearl River Estuary; vertical exchange time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that since the mainstream was dammed by the TGD, the water age increases significantly by approximately 2 to 5 times from the estuary to the dam. Downstream of the dam the longitudinal ageing rate of water becomes discordant in an annual cycle, and the replenished discharge in dry season accelerates the water transport.

The model couples a 1D river flow module and a 2D coastal circulation module. Two transport timescales, i.e., the age and the arrival time, are introduced to characterize the contaminant transport process. The age is the time for a particle taken to enter the domain of interest after it left the place where the age is initially set to zero. The arrival time, on the other hand, is the age of the particle arriving at a particular place most quickly after release. It is useful for emergency responses to such an accident as toxic substance leakage. By the numerical model, the age and the arrival time under various conditions in the coastal area of Guangxi, China are studied in details. The age distribution and the arrival time of particles at a specific location are shown to closely rely on the coastal hydrodynamic environment in addition to the distance of the location from the source where particles are released. Particles released at spring tide and at ebb tide are found to spread more quickly than those released at neap tide and at flood tide, respectively. A large carrying discharge of river reduces the ages of the contaminants from the river concerned when transported to a place within the coastal area, while it has less influence on the arrival time, particularly in a place along the coast.","2013","2021-10-08 12:17:32","2021-10-08 13:05:33","","176–184","","","130","","","Application of transport timescales to coastal environmental assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","Publisher: Elsevier","<p>建立了基于随机游走粒子跟踪技术的数值模型来模拟从河流排放到中国广西沿海地区的污染物的传输过程。该模型耦合了一个一维河流流量模块和一个二维沿海环流模块。引入了两个运输时间尺度，即年龄和到达时间，以表征污染物运输过程。年龄是粒子离开年龄最初设置为零的位置后进入感兴趣域的时间。另一方面，到达时间是粒子在释放后最快到达特定地点的年龄。对于有毒物质泄漏等事故的应急响应非常有用。通过数值模型，详细研究了广西沿海地区不同条件下的年龄和到达时间。粒子在特定位置的年龄分布和到达时间除了与粒子释放源位置的距离外，还密切依赖于沿海水动力环境。发现在大潮和退潮时释放的颗粒分别比在小潮和大潮时释放的颗粒传播得更快。河流的大量携带排放减少了相关河流污染物在运输到沿海地区时的年龄，而对到达时间的影响较小，特别是在沿海地区。</p>","/Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/8DZ5VXH8/S0301479713005872.html","","arrival time; particle tracking; random walk; water age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It allows any passive tracer field with an atmospheric source to be constructed by superposing sea surface contributions with a generalized Green's function called the boundary propagator of the passive tracer equation. The boundary propagator has the interpretation of the joint water-mass and transit-time distribution from the sea surface. The theory thus includes the classical oceanographic idea of water-mass analysis and extends it to allow for a distribution of transit times from the sea surface. The joint water-mass and transit-time distribution contains complete information about the transport processes in the flow. It captures this information in a more accessible way than using velocity and diffusivity fields, however, at least for the case of sequestration and transport of dissolved material by the ocean circulation. The boundary propagator is thus the natural quantity to consider when discussing both steady-state and transient ocean tracers, including the inverse problem of interpreting tracer data in terms of ocean circulation. Two constraints on the shape of the transit-time distributions are derived. First, the asymptotic behavior for a steady, or time-averaged, circulation is exponential decay. Second, integrated over the whole ocean, the transit-time distribution from the sea surface cannot increase. The theory is illustrated using a one-dimensional advection–diffusion model, a box model, and a North Atlantic general circulation model.","2002","2021-10-08 12:21:59","2021-10-08 13:00:27","","1932–1946","","6","32","","","A generalized transport theory","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","<p>报告了描述和理解平流和扩散海洋运输的一般理论。它允许通过将海面贡献与称为无源示踪方程的边界传播子的广义格林函数叠加来构建具有大气源的任何无源示踪场。边界传播器可以解释来自海面的联合水质量和传输时间分布。因此，该理论包括水质量分析的经典海洋学思想，并将其扩展为允许从海面分布传输时间。联合水量和传输时间分布包含有关流中传输过程的完整信息。然而，它以比使用速度和扩散率场更容易获取的方式捕获这些信息，至少对于海洋环流对溶解物质的封存和运输而言是这样。因此，在讨论稳态和瞬态海洋示踪剂时，边界传播器是要考虑的自然量，包括根据海洋环流解释示踪剂数据的逆问题。导出了对传输时间分布形状的两个约束。首先，稳定或时间平均的循环的渐近行为是指数衰减。其次，在整个海洋上整合，来自海面的通过时间分布不能增加。该理论使用一维对流-扩散模型、箱模型和北大西洋环流模型进行说明。</p>","/Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/8WF4QP9H/1520-0485_2002_032_1932_agttwm_2.0.co_2.html; /Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/4ZPLXVP7/Haine and Hall - 2002 - A generalized transport theory Water-mass composi.pdf","","advection–diffusion model; box model; general circulation model; passive tracer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a major problem with interpreting these tracer ages is that different tracers can yield different ages, and at present, it is not clear what aspects of the transport are measured by the different tracers. We use the concept of a distribution of transit times to compare the timescales derived from different tracers, including CFCs, tritium-helium, and radioactive tracers. By performing a systematic study over a range of transit time distributions we examine under what conditions two tracers yield similar or different ages. It is shown that there can be significant differences in tracer ages and that in general, tracer ages are not fundamental timescales of the flow. Furthermore, even if ages from two tracers are similar these ages can be very different from the mean (ideal) age or the age of a third tracer. It is also shown that significant temporal variations in tracer ages can occur for steady transport and that these changes are of similar magnitude to the changes in CFC and tritium-helium ages observed in the North Atlantic and North Pacific over the 1980s and 1990s. Accounting for the changes in tracer ages caused by steady transport is necessary before attributing changes in tracer ages to changes in transport. The possibility of using the differences in ages from different tracers to infer information about the transit time distribution is also examined. It is shown that two tracer ages can constrain the first two moments (mean age and width) of the distribution, but how tightly these are constrained depends on the tracers used, the certainty of the age calculations, and the flow characteristics.","2003","2021-10-08 12:21:59","2021-10-08 14:32:30","","","","C5","108","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","Publisher: Wiley Online Library","<p>化学示踪剂的测量，其空间梯度主要是由于源和/或汇的时间依赖性，通常用于定义“示踪剂年龄”，以诊断运输。然而，解释这些示踪剂年龄的一个主要问题是不同的示踪剂可以产生不同的年龄，目前尚不清楚不同示踪剂测量运输的哪些方面。我们使用传输时间分布的概念来比较来自不同示踪剂（包括 CFC、氚-氦和放射性示踪剂）的时间尺度。通过对一系列传输时间分布进行系统研究，我们检查了两个示踪剂在什么条件下产生相似或不同的年龄。结果表明，示踪剂年龄可能存在显着差异，并且一般而言，示踪剂年龄不是流动的基本时间尺度。此外，即使两个示踪剂的年龄相似，这些年龄也可能与平均（理想）年龄或第三个示踪剂的年龄大不相同。还表明，对于稳定传输，示踪剂年龄的显着时间变化可能发生，这些变化与 1980 年代和 1990 年代在北大西洋和北太平洋观察到的 CFC 和氚-氦年龄变化的幅度相似。在将示踪剂年龄的变化归因于运输的变化之前，有必要考虑由稳定运输引起的示踪剂年龄的变化。还研究了使用来自不同示踪剂的年龄差异来推断有关传输时间分布的信息的可能性。结果表明，两个示踪剂年龄可以约束分布的前两个矩（平均年龄和宽度），但这些约束的紧密程度取决于所使用的示踪剂、年龄计算的确定性和流动特性。</p>","/Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/VIGDFPJY/2002JC001325.html; /Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/XMWZBMJ7/2002JC001325.html","","CFCs; chemical tracers; radioactive tracers; tracer ages; tritium-helium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two dimensionless parameters are introduced to diagnose the relationship between the vertical exchange process and the biochemical DO consumption and the influence of gravitational circulation on replenishment of bottom DO. The relative magnitudes of these timescales provide a linkage between the physical and biochemical processes. The hypoxic and anoxic conditions in deep waters of Chesapeake Bay are successfully interpreted with these three proposed timescales. Because the Bay is a long estuary, the replenishment of the bottom DO due to gravitational circulation diminishes as the bottom water travels farther upstream. The bottom DO is mainly modulated by the vertical exchange process in the middle and upper portions of the Bay. In addition to other physical processes that affect vertical exchange, wind and freshwater are the major predictors of the vertical exchange time. The model is applicable to Chesapeake Bay and other estuaries with persistent gravitational circulation if the dimensionless parameters can be appropriately estimated.","2013","2021-10-08 12:27:41","2021-10-08 15:36:34","","2237–2248","","6","58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","Publisher: Wiley Online Library","<p>提出了基于重力循环、垂直交换和生化过程的总耗氧率的时间尺度的简化概念模型，以深入了解河口动力学与底部水溶解氧 (DO) 之间的关系。引入两个无量纲参数来诊断垂直交换过程与生化溶解氧消耗之间的关系以及重力环流对底部溶解氧补充的影响。这些时间尺度的相对大小提供了物理和生化过程之间的联系。切萨皮克湾深水中的缺氧和缺氧条件可以用这三个建议的时间尺度成功解释。由于海湾是一个长河口，随着底部水流向上游更远，重力循环对底部溶解氧的补充减少。底部溶解氧主要受海湾中上部垂直交换过程的调节。除了影响垂直交换的其他物理过程外，风和淡水是垂直交换时间的主要预测因素。如果无量纲参数可以适当估计，该模型适用于切萨皮克湾和其他具有持续引力环流的河口。</p>","/Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/FSW4HDQH/lo.2013.58.6.html; /Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/WL5C9AEV/Shen et al. - 2013 - Using timescales to interpret dissolved oxygen dis.pdf","","2 layer model; CART; Chesapeake Bay; dimensionless parameter; HEM-3D; timescales; water age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I.; Cortis, A.; Revelli, Roberto; Ridolfi, Luca","A continuous time random walk approach to the stream transport of solutes","Water Resources Research","","","","","The transport of solutes in rivers is influenced by the exchange of water between the river and the underlying hyporheic zone. The residence times of solutes in the hyporheic zone are typically much longer than traveltimes in the stream, resulting in a significant delay in the downstream propagation of solutes. A new model for this process is proposed here on the basis of the continuous time random walk (CTRW) approach. The CTRW is a generalization of the classic random walk that can include arbitrary distributions of waiting times, and it is particularly suited to deal with the long residence times arising from hyporheic exchange. Inclusion of suitable hyporheic residence time distributions in the CTRW leads to a generalized advection-dispersion equation for in-stream concentration breakthrough curves that includes the effects of specific hyporheic exchange processes. Here examples are presented for advective hyporheic exchange resulting from regular and irregular series of bedforms. A second major advantage of the CTRW approach is that the combined effects of different processes affecting overall downstream transport can be incorporated in the model by convolving separate waiting time distributions for each relevant process. The utility of this approach is illustrated by analyzing the effects of local-scale sediment heterogeneity on bedform-induced hyporheic exchange. The ability to handle arbitrarily wide residence time distributions and the ability to assess the combined effects of multiple transport processes makes the CTRW model framework very useful for the study of solute transport problems in rivers. The model presented here can be easily extended to represent different types of surface-subsurface exchange processes and the transport of both conservative and nonconservative substances in rivers.","2007","2021-10-08 12:27:41","2021-10-08 12:55:54","","","","10","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","Publisher: Wiley Online Library","<p>河流中溶质的迁移受河流与下流带之间的水交换的影响。下流带中溶质的停留时间通常比流中的传播时间长得多，导致溶质下游传播的显着延迟。在连续时间随机游走 (CTRW) 方法的基础上，这里提出了该过程的新模型。 CTRW 是经典随机游走的推广，可以包括等待时间的任意分布，特别适合处理由低流交换引起的长停留时间。在 CTRW 中包含合适的低流滞留时间分布会导致包含特定低流交换过程影响的流内浓度突破曲线的广义平流-分散方程。这里给出了由规则和不规则系列床型引起的平流低流交换的例子。 CTRW 方法的第二个主要优点是，通过对每个相关过程的单独等待时间分布进行卷积，可以将影响整体下游运输的不同过程的综合影响纳入模型中。通过分析局部尺度沉积物异质性对床型诱导的潜流交换的影响，说明了这种方法的实用性。处理任意宽的停留时间分布的能力和评估多种运输过程的综合影响的能力使得 CTRW 模型框架对于研究河流中的溶质运输问题非常有用。这里介绍的模型可以很容易地扩展到代表不同类型的地表-地下交换过程以及河流中保守和非保守物质的传输。</p>","/Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/ZBX3MLTH/Boano et al. - 2007 - A continuous time random walk approach to the stre.pdf; /Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/JQFINCXF/2007WR006062.html","","CTRW; random walk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two renewing water types, i.e., water from the upstream boundary of the delta and water from both the upstream and the downstream boundaries, are considered, and their age is calculated as the time elapsed since entering the delta. The residence time of the water originally in the domain (i.e., the time needed to hit an open boundary for the first time) and the exposure time (i.e., the total time spent in the domain of interest) are then computed. Simulations are performed for both low and high flow conditions, revealing that (i) age, residence time, and exposure time are clearly related to the river volumetric flow rate, and (ii) those timescales are of the order of one spring-neap tidal cycle. In the main deltaic channels, the variation of the diagnostic timescales caused by the tide is about 35% of their averaged value. The age of renewing water from the upstream boundary of the delta monotonically increases from the river mouth to the delta front, while the age of renewing water from both the upstream and the downstream boundaries monotonically increases from the river mouth and the delta front to the middle delta. Variations of the residence and the exposure times coincide with the changes of the flow velocity, and these timescales are more sensitive to the change of flow dynamics than the age. The return coefficient, which measures the propensity of water to re-enter the domain of interest after leaving it for the first time, is of about 0.3 in the middle region of the delta.","2020","2021-10-08 12:30:57","2021-10-08 13:52:01","","1017","","4","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","<p style=""text-align: left;"">水更新时间尺度，即年龄、停留时间和暴露时间，根据成分导向的年龄和停留时间理论 (CART) 定义，通过非结构化网格、有限元模型 Second generation Louvain 计算-la-Neuve 冰海模型 (SLIM) 在 Mahakam Delta（印度尼西亚婆罗洲岛）。考虑了两种更新水类型，即来自三角洲上游边界的水和来自上游和下游边界的水，它们的年龄计算为自进入三角洲以来经过的时间。然后计算水最初在域中的停留时间（即第一次到达开放边界所需的时间）和暴露时间（即在感兴趣的域中花费的总时间）。对低流量和高流量条件进行了模拟，表明 (i) 年龄、停留时间和暴露时间与河流体积流量明显相关，并且 (ii) 这些时间尺度大约是一个春季小潮循环。在主要三角洲河道中，潮汐引起的诊断时间尺度变化约为平均值的35%。三角洲上游边界更新水年龄从河口到三角洲前缘单调增加，而上下游边界更新水年龄从河口和三角洲前缘向中部单调增加三角洲。停留时间和暴露时间的变化与流速的变化相吻合，这些时间尺度对流动动力学的变化比年龄更敏感。衡量水首次离开后重新进入感兴趣域的倾向的返回系数在三角洲中部约为 0.3。</p>","/Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/VEYNFT2T/htm.html; /Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/RBVIPR74/1017.html","","CART; exposure time; Mahakam Delta; residence time; SLIM; water age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three different timescales are used to better understand and characterize the dynamics of the estuary: the age of the renewing water, the residence time and the exposure time. The residence time is the time taken by a water parcel to leave the estuary for the first time while the exposure time is the total time spent by a water parcel in the estuary including re-entries. The age of a renewing water parcel is defined as the time elapsed since it entered the estuary. The renewing water was split into three types: the water originating from the sea, the water originating from the upstream fresh tidal rivers and the water originating from the different canals and docks connected to the estuary. Every timescale is computed at any time and position by means of the finite-element, unstructured-mesh model SLIM. This results in movies of the timescale fields (shown as Supplementary material), allowing a detailed analysis of their spatial and temporal variabilities. The effect of the M2 tide and the discharge regime (winter, summer or average situation) on the timescales is also investigated. Tidally-averaged timescales vary little over the width of the estuary and hence exhibit a virtually one-dimensional behaviour. However, around these average values, the timescales can vary hugely over a tidal cycle, with amplitudes that significantly depend on the space coordinates. The reason thereof has yet to be elucidated. These results underscore the need for two- or three-dimensional models with high temporal resolution for investigating the dynamics of the Scheldt Estuary.","2012","2021-10-08 12:30:57","2021-10-08 15:47:43","","74–86","","","94","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","Publisher: Elsevier","<p>使用面向成分的年龄和停留时间理论 (CART) 的概念，我们计算与斯海尔德河口（荷兰/比利时）的水更新相关的时间尺度。三个不同的时间尺度用于更好地理解和表征河口的动态：更新水的年龄、停留时间和暴露时间。停留时间是指水团第一次离开河口所花费的时间，而暴露时间是指水团在河口停留的总时间，包括重新进入河口的时间。更新水包的年龄定义为自进入河口以来经过的时间。更新水分为三类：源自海洋的水、源自上游潮汐河的水和源自与河口相连的不同运河和码头的水。每个时间尺度都通过有限元、非结构化网格模型 SLIM 在任何时间和位置计算。这导致了时间尺度场的电影（显示为补充材料），允许对其空间和时间变化进行详细分析。还研究了 M2 潮汐和排放状况（冬季、夏季或平均情况）对时间尺度的影响。</p> <p>潮汐平均时间尺度在河口的宽度上变化很小，因此表现出几乎一维的行为。然而，围绕这些平均值，时间尺度在一个潮汐周期内可能会发生巨大变化，其幅度在很大程度上取决于空间坐标。其原因尚未阐明。这些结果强调需要具有高时间分辨率的二维或三维模型来研究斯海尔德河口的动力学。</p>","/Users/yulong/Zotero/storage/R8GHDXAL/S0924796311002545.html","","age of the renewing water; CART; exposure time; renewing water parcel; residence time; Scheldt Estuary; SLIM; three types renewing water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
